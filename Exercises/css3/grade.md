#### Exercise Focus: 
CSS3

#### Points: 
10/15

#### Instructor Notes: 
Your CSS looks good, however I noticed something about your HTML that I would like you to fix.

```html
<h2>Home &nbsp; | &nbsp; HTML5 &nbsp; | &nbsp; CSS3 &nbsp; | &nbsp; jQuery</h2>
```

This should actually be a small navigation system, if you make the adjustments we can bump your score up to 15/15. Let me know if you have any questions on this!
