1. I saw that you were using Modernizr, but then I noticed that none of the files you were trying to import actually
existed. So I'm afraid I can't give you points for those requirements.
2. Scaling the browser introduced some layout issues (not mobile friendly)
3. You did a great job! I loved that you built your banner with Canvas and it looks great! I also liked the your fallback
image for IE8, I almost didn't realize it was an image!
